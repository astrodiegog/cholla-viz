Here we place code to visualize any Cholla outputs: individual processor information, snapshot-side data, or on-the-fly analysis outputs

This code was designed to be flexible enough to serve as a template for similar plots

Specific placement of objects within figures were determined using [diego-style](https://github.com/astrodiegog/diego-style).
