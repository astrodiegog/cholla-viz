## Distribution

These files are created when building using PyPA [build](https://github.com/pypa/build).

`tar.gz` serves as the source distribution while `.whl` is a built distribution. 

The source distribution holds metadata and source files to be used by pip when installing, and serves as a hard archive of the package.

The built distribution includes the compiled code, and is used for much quicker installation.
